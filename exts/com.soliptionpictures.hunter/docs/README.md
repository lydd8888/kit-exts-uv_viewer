# UV viwer Extension [com.soliptionpictures.hunter]

This is a simple extension to show UV of selected mesh

This Extension is heavily inspried by Camera Reticle Extension 
I create this entension mainly to check if my UV is right since Omniverse does not natively support UV check

## Adding This Extension
To add a this extension to your Omniverse app:
1. Go into: Extension Manager -> Gear Icon -> Extension Search Path 
2. Add Link to the path: ../uv_viewer_extension/kit-exts-uv_viewer/exts
